Samvera Connect (hashtag #samvera2021) is a chance for the Samvera Community to come together with an emphasis on synchronizing efforts, technical development, plans, and community links. This year, while we still cannot meet face-to-face, we’re putting together an exciting event that will build on what we learned from last year's successful online event. The meeting program is aimed at existing users, managers and developers and at new folks who may be just “kicking the tires” on Samvera and who want to know more. Samvera advertises this yearly conference with the slogan “as a Samvera Partner or user, if you can only make it to one Samvera meeting this academic year, this is the one to attend!”
